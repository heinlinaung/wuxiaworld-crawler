From a little, unknown cultivator until now, where he could stand among the strong. All of these changes were the growth Wang Lin had experienced in his life.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the life and death reincarnation cycle, he saw through life and death. This allowed him to struggle through his crisis and find life in death. This ultimately allowed his defying will to appear in his heart and he dared to become a heaven-defying cultivator.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Splitting the stars, slicing the moon, and looking down upon the heavens was the path of a heaven-defying cultivator. He had seen through life and death, so there was nothing to fear! These were all the thoughts that the life and death domain had brought Wang Lin.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had become strong because he had the intent! However, the heavens were ruthless and would force all life to obey it! It was also due to the intent of all life that countless daos were formed for everyone to comprehend. This was the gift the heavens had given to all living beings, to give them meaning to cultivate. This was following the heavens and cultivating a smooth path!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin wouldn&#x2019;t enter this path!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After life and death was karma. After Wang Lin&#x2019;s domain went through a metamorphosis, he was like a head scholar among mortals. He no longer cared about life and death, but pursued the true meaning of the world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Karma was like this. He saw through karmic cause and caught glimpse of karmic effect. Everything in this world had its own karma. After completing his pursuit of karma, Wang Lin&#x2019;s life entered a peak. As his mind evolved, his dao heart was confirmed even more. As he went through cycles of karma, his dao heart became even more deeply rooted. The world became different in his eyes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These heavens are not my heavens! In other people&#x2019;s eyes, the heavens and earth were boundless, and they didn&#x2019;t know where it ended. They searched the heavens and earth blindly. In Wang Lin&#x2019;s eyes, the boundary of the heavens and earth was no longer important. The heavens were karmic cause and earth was karmic effect. The world was a cycle of karma. He wanted to walk out of this karmic furnace, he wanted to know what was outside of this world.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After reaching this step, Wang Lin had reached the limit of his domain. He was also in the circle he had drawn around Li Qianmei and Lu Yuncong.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Lin&#x2019;s appearance and possessing the Heaven Defying Bead allowed Wang Lin&#x2019;s karma domain to go through another metamorphosis after reaching completion. His domain evolved and he began to explore the origins of true and false!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The true and false domain was a deep comprehension, and ordinary people simply weren&#x2019;t qualified to grasp it. This was already at the boundary of the heavenly dao, just one step away from reaching the core!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over the countless years, it wasn&#x2019;t that there were no cultivators that had reached this step, it&#x2019;s just that there were simply too few&#x2026; Domain determines one&#x2019;s cultivation level, and the depth of the domain brings drastic differences to one&#x2019;s power.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What Wang Lin was seeking was the grand dao. Although it seemed the same as everyone else, due to his understanding of dao, the path he saw had far surpassed the goals of others.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The liquid formed by the three rank 11 pills was consumed by Wang Lin. His comprehension didn&#x2019;t end and kept going. His storage space opened before him and bottles of pills flew out. There were rank 8, 9, and 10 pills inside.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had forgotten about time. While he gained enlightenment, he picked up the pills one by one. He didn&#x2019;t devour them; they all collapsed when they got close to his mouth. The countless dao intents from the beast souls merged with the vortex and were being confirmed by Wang Lin.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More and more chaotic dao intents appeared and began to spread once more.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lost Ones outside the valley gradually gained a hint of clarity in their confused eyes. The Enlightened Ones&#x2019; ethereal bodies began to turn corporeal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those rank 12 fierce beasts no longer gave off fierce auras while seeking dao.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Master Ashen Pine struggled to protect his mind. It was as if he could be overrun by this chaotic dao intent at any moment. Even more dao intent appeared outside the valley.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire Seven-Colored Realm seemed to be filled with the dao intents Wang Lin had abandoned and became twisted. It was as if the countless dao intents were colliding.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As it spread, even the depths of the Seven-Colored Realm became like this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Wang Lin continued to become enlightened, his mind gradually flew out of his body. He saw the valley, he saw himself sitting in the valley, he saw the pills floating before him collapsing one by one.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His mind slowly spread out with the valley as the center. When his mind swept past the Enlightened Ones, their bodies all trembled.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lost Ones and the fierce beasts were like this as well. As for Master Ashen Pine, his dao heart suddenly collapsed and his eyes became filled with confusion.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">None of this caught Wang Lin&#x2019;s interest at all. His mind continued to spread out, and he saw a burly man sitting in a cave in a mountain in the outer region. The burly man&#x2019;s eyes revealed panic as he stared ahead. He opened his mouth but was unable to utter a word.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even after Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind left, the burly man still hadn&#x2019;t recovered from the shock.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind circled around the entire outer region and passed through all the caves before heading to the wall-like mountain range. However, along the way, he saw the restriction where the Life and Death Restriction had fused with the Annihilation Restriction.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He saw the pale-faced old woman in green sitting there, cultivating with her eyes closed. Her dao heart was a mess and unexpectedly showed signs of splitting. Her appearance rapidly changed; sometimes she was old, sometimes she was ancient, and sometimes she was middle-aged.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old woman didn&#x2019;t cause Wang Lin to stop. He continued into the mountain covered in fog. The fog wasn&#x2019;t able to stop him at all, and inside he saw two mountains surrounded in restrictions.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Time Restriction also wasn&#x2019;t able to stop Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind. On the first mountain, there was nothing but a stone tablet. There was nothing on the stone tablet, but it gave off an ancient aura.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, in Wang Lin&#x2019;s eyes, the ancient aura gradually disappeared. The entire stone tablet was like a treasure.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind spread out, he went to the second mountain protected by the Time Restriction. There he saw a towering statue and a giant, stone gate halfway up the mountain. There was a lightning mark on the gate.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His mind went through the stone gate and he saw orbs of seven-colored light. There were beast souls sealed within from rank 7 to rank 13...</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside this cave, he saw a young girl that looked similar to the old woman. Her face was ashen and she looked dead, but her body was trembling.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin also saw that there was a hidden space at the peak, and inside he saw the tablet again. He also saw the skeleton that was pinned against the tablet with two seven-colored nails.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, his mind was attracted by the skeleton and landed on the countless words carved on the skeleton.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if thunder had exploded in Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind. His originally calm mind suddenly became disturbed and a drastic change occured. His mind gathered on the skeleton and the text was engraved in his heart. There words were exactly the same words that echoed in his mind.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;...

He went deeper into this fog-covered land and for the first time entered the depths of the Seven-Colored Realm.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was also fog there, but it was even more dense. However, this still couldn&#x2019;t stop Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind. He saw three youths wearing strange clothes. The youth with the crescent moon mark, he had seen this person before...</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth with the lightning mark softly said, &#x201C;This place is very mysterious. What makes it even more strange is that I can feel the aura of my Flash Thunder Clan&#x2019;s ancestor.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth with the flame mark between his eyebrows behind him rubbed his temples. He had a gloomy expression as he softly said, &#x201C;It is indeed very strange. After entering here, I can feel something calling me in my heart. Also, I feel like my ancestral mark is going to leave my body.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The last youth with the crescent moon mark was cautiously looking around and his eyes lit up. Just as he was about to speed up, his expression changed greatly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind swept by the three youths. At this moment, it was as if a bolt of lightning had struck the youth with the lightning mark between his eyebrows. The lightning mark began to flash violently.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth with the crescent moon mark also trembled as if he had thought of something, but he wasn&#x2019;t sure. His face was pale and a huge wave was set off in his heart.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most shocked was the youth with the flame mark. The moment Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind swept by, he felt like he had lost all the strength in his body. An unspeakable fear washed over his body, and the flame mark began to burn as if it wanted to burn his body into ashes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was fortunate that this feeling only lasted for a moment. When Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind passed, the pain disappeared.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a long time, the three looked at each other and saw the shock in each other&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;What a powerful mind!&#x201D; The youth with the lightning mark gasped.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;It must be an ancestor from my Fire Sparrow Clan. That mind just now contained was certainly one of my clan&#x2019;s ancestors, or else my mark wouldn&#x2019;t have reacted like this!&#x201D; The youth with the flame mark was pale, but his eyes were filled with greed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only the last person, the youth with the crescent moon mark, remained silent. He pondered. There was fear hidden in his eyes. The moment Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind passed by, he recalled that nightmarish scene he refused to remember.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Could it be&#x2026; him&#x2026; Not possible.

The divine sense turned into a hand and mercilessly tried to grab Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the moment it reached over, Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind quickly withdrew. The surroundings became unreal, as if the entire world was becoming blurry.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A surprised sound came from the void, and at the same time, a white-haired old man walked out from the peak. He looked at the void and rushed forward. He then raised his right hand and slammed forward.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was thunderous echo and Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind trembled.

His right hand seemed to be able to cover the sky and reach at Wang Lin. His palm seemed to contain a powerful suction force that caused Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind to twist and be pulled in.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind quickly contracted and formed an illusory figure. He stared at the old man, but Wang Lin didn&#x2019;t speak. Wang Lin waved his right hand and all the dao intents he had abandoned in the Seven-Colored Realm rushed toward himself.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These dao intents were endless, and as they rushed in, all the fog in the Seven-Colored Realm was stirred up. Even the seven-colored light dimmed. The number of dao intents that had gathered reached a frightening degree in an instant.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Wang Lin waved his right hand the dao intents formed a giant vortex. This caused the old man to reveal a serious expression and stop his giant hand.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;I was comprehending dao and my mind randomly scattered.

Don&#x2019;t repeat it!&#x201D; He waved his sleeves and returned into the mountain. He then withdrew his divine sense.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin retreated. With the endless dao intents surrounding him, he crossed the realm and returned to his body inside the valley.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A moment later, he slowly opened his eyes and a flash of coldness appeared in his eyes. If that old man was determined to keep him there, Wang Lin would have retaliated with all the dao intents.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing up, Wang Lin pointed at the sky and the endless dao intents rushed into the valley. The dao intents rushed in from all over the seven-colored realm and condensed into a ball of black light in Wang Lin&#x2019;s right hand.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A moment later, all the dao intents Wang Lin had discarded had gathered inside this ball of light. All the Lost Ones outside the valley were confused again and scattered. The Enlightened Ones began to mutter and floated away.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the rank 12 fierce beasts seemed to become sober and roared as they left. Everything outside the valley returned to normal. Master Ashen Pine&#x2019;s face was pale and he quickly retreated.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin&#x2019;s right hand reached out and popping sounds came from the black light before it turned into a black crystal. Wang Lin held the black crystal and looked at it for a bit. This was a treasure formed from the chaotic dao intents from all those pills, and it was a very powerful treasure. If it collapsed, the dao intents that would rush out were enough to collapse the dao heart of even a Nirvana Shatterer cultivator.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;What is he guarding&#x2026;&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin began to ponder. He thought about the old man. It was obvious that the reason he didn&#x2019;t attack was because he was worried about something. That old man was at the late stage of Nirvana Shatterer but stayed alone at the mountain. If he said he wasn&#x2019;t guarding something or plotting something, Wang Lin wouldn&#x2019;t believe it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;There were also those three young cultivators, and I&#x2019;ve seen one of them before.

His heart was filled with anger. He thought that his injury had recovered and could easily kill this person named Lu. At most he would spend some effort breaking the restriction. However, when he came within 10,000 feet of Wang Lin, his dao heart was caught and his mind almost collapsed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In particular, when he was within the endless chaotic daos, he was like a lonely boat in the raging sea. When Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind swept by, his mind trembled. He had a vague guess that Wang Lin had gained enlightenment and improved his domain, and maybe his his cultivation level was about to increase!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about this, Master Ashen Pine&#x2019;s heart felt a chill.

Now that Wang Lin had a breakthrough, he would undoubtedly die if they were to fight!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Master Ashen Pine felt bitter and roared at the sky.

I&#x2019;ll destroy the seven-colored crack so that all of you will be trapped here forever! Only then will the anger in my heart ease a little! That person named Lu must have searched Pang Decai&#x2019;s soul when he killed him. But even Pang Decai doesn&#x2019;t know the real way to leave.

Wang Lin&#x2019;s figure appeared in the distance and killing intent surrounded him.

Wang Lin immediately appeared behind Master Ashen Pine and placed his right hand on Master Ashen Pine&#x2019;s head.

Master Ashen Pine&#x2019;s origin soul trembled and the madness intensified. After just a moment, the madness reached a peak and he let out a roar.

This was his first time using the seven-colored nail. Based on his personal experience from forcing out the seven-colored nail, the seven-colored nail would instantly absorb all your vitality at the moment of madness. Then you would die while going mad.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he didn&#x2019;t expect a blood bead to form at the moment a death!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the blood bead charge into the sky, Wang Lin didn&#x2019;t hesitate to charge toward it.

It rapidly rotated and a mysterious suction force entered his right hand. The blood bead trembled and suddenly stopped struggling. It entered Wang Lin&#x2019;s right hand and entered the Heaven Defying Bead inside his origin soul.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then seven-colored light gathered in Wang Lin&#x2019;s right hand and the nail reformed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This strange scene shocked Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind, but he didn&#x2019;t reveal a hint of it.

The origin energy formed a vortex that floated above the valley. Below the vortex was Wang Lin.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The history of the Seven-Colored Realm was mysterious, and there were many strange things here that were filled with danger. However, it was also a huge opportunity for Wang Lin.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he absorbed Master Ashen Pine&#x2019;s memories, Wang Lin learned even more about the Seven-Colored Realm. He even found out about the use of the bottle of liquid and the method to leave this place.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he hadn&#x2019;t broken through from the early stage of Nirvana Cleanser to the mid stage, he would have hesitated. After all, Wang Lin had gained a much better understanding of the dangers here after taking Master Ashen Pine&#x2019;s memories. More importantly, he knew of the existence of that mountain the depths of the Seven-Colored Realm.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Wang Lin&#x2019;s domain had a breakthrough, so he just needed to absorb enough origin crystal to reach the mid stage of Nirvana Cleanser. At that time, with his ancient god body, he could kill mid stage Nirvana Shatterer cultivators without any difficulty. Only late stage Nirvana Shatterer cultivators would be a challenge.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;If I can reach the peak of the Nirvana Cleanser stage, those late stage Nirvana Shatterer old monsters won&#x2019;t be my match!&#x201D;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#xA0;Wang Lin took a deep breath and the large amount of origin energy rushed into his body. It was all absorbed into his body.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Popping sounds echoed and his hair moved without any wind. His origin soul was also cultivating and continued to swell as he devoured the endless origin energy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As more and more origin energy entered, Wang Lin&#x2019;s origin soul became as large as his body. Wang Lin&#x2019;s eyes suddenly opened. His gaze was like the bright stars, and it pierced through the heavens and earth.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment he opened his eyes, the large amount of origin crystals around him collapsed into dust, forming a ring around him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mid stage Nirvana Cleanser!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin smiled and let out a mouthful of foil air. Then he waved his hand and a jade bottle appeared. This was the thing he had taken from Master Ashen Pine.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Use the Lost Ones to devour dao and the Enlightened Ones to nourish dao. The nourished dao is then absorbed by the four stone tablets. Then use the scripture engraved on the skeleton under the tablet to transform this dao into an unimaginable force. This force is then used to extract this black blood from the skeleton. But it isn&#x2019;t blood, it&#x2019;s the dao essence of that person!&#x201D;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#xA0;Wang Lin&#x2019;s eyes shined brightly. This was the important information he had obtained from Master Ashen Pine&#x2019;s mind.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin didn&#x2019;t find how Master Ashen Pine had obtained his information. After all, Master Ashen Pine was a mid stage Nirvana Shatterer cultivator, and the soul search spell wasn&#x2019;t without flaws. Wang Lin couldn&#x2019;t obtain everything.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;The key of this dao essence is the identity of that half-skeleton! There are two stone tablets, and from what I&#x2019;ve seen, each should have half a skeleton nailed below them, so it was one person!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;This person must have been very famous. I don&#x2019;t know if he was killed or if someone dug up his skeleton, but they used this heaven-shattering method to force out his dao essence! If I drink his dao essence, I can obtain his dao!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;The scripture on the bones was carved on there later. It is unknown what powerful cultivator turned their spell into a scripture and thought of this terrifying idea!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;However, this dao essence can&#x2019;t be consumed immediately. Once one drinks it, they fall asleep for an unknown amount of time. Master Ashen Pine&#x2019;s plan was to find an absolutely safe place here, drink it, and wait for the day he would awaken. This was also the reason why he didn&#x2019;t just drink it when he was fighting the old woman in green!&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The place he had chosen was the mountain in the depths of the Seven-Colored Realm! Only, there was no sign of that white-haired old man in Master Ashen Pine&#x2019;s memories.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#xA0;Wang Lin&#x2019;s eyes lit up and he stared at the bottle in his left hand.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Interesting. Everything here seems to produce dao for the stone tablets to absorb; even the fierce beasts are the same. As for why there aren&#x2019;t any rank 13 beasts, it is like all of them were killed and had their dao souls taken.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;All of this is for the dao essence in this jade bottle. However, the importance of this dao essence to the powerful cultivator that set this up is likely not as simple as drinking it...</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;The old man on the mountain must be guarding something. Perhaps what he is guarding is connected to to all this!&#x201D;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#xA0;Wang Lin pondered a bit and put the bottle away.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Sima Mo&#x2019;s jade said that there are four tablets, but when my mind spread out, there were only two. One of stone tablets didn&#x2019;t even have a skeleton or bottle beneath it&#x2026; This is a bit strange.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After pondering for a bit, Wang Lin looked at the nine caves on the mountain. He had only checked the first three, but after that, he didn&#x2019;t open them. His body flickered and he arrived before the fourth cave.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He placed his right hand on the rock that was sealing the cave and the origin energy in his body surged. He gently pressed on the rock and popping sounds came out. All the restrictions on it collapsed and moved to the side.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the rock moved, Wang Lin&#x2019;s lightning gaze looked inside and he frowned.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fourth cave was completely empty.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stepping into the cave, Wang Lin carefully looked around but still found nothing.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After pondering a bit, Wang Lin arrived next to the fifth cave. This cave also had a restriction sealing it, and it was actually the Time Restriction. The ripples of the restriction were extremely powerful.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It would be difficult to break this restriction. Wang Lin raised his right hand and formed seals, and restrictions immediately appeared. As his hand landed on the rock, a rumble came out from inside it and large amounts of ripples immediately appeared.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment it turned transparent, Wang Lin&#x2019;s eyes lit up. He was startled when he saw through the transparent rock and saw what was inside.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were people in this cave.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Four cultivators with tattered clothes, no hair, and dead eyes walked in confusion inside the cave. It was as if they had never stopped once over the countless years and continued walking.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a formation on the ground of the cave. This formation released a gentle light that surrounded the four of them and slowly drilled into their bodies. There was also a piece of jade a the center.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Lost Ones!&#x201D;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#xA0;Wang Lin immediately recognized the four of them. He thought of the information Sima Mo had left behind and gasped. He quickly arrived before the sixth cave and used the same method to make the rock transparent to look inside.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were three people inside the 6th cave. These three people seemed to have no physical bodies and were only ghosts. They drifted in the cave and seemed to be chanting something, but with the rock blocking the way, Wang Lin couldn&#x2019;t hear anything.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Enlightened Ones&#x2026;&#x201D;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#xA0;Wang Lin saw that there were even more restrictions inside. These restrictions were there to completely seal them, making it impossible for them to come out unless they awakened one day and opened the restriction on their own.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was also a jade placed in the cave.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taking a deep breath, Wang &#xA0;Lin walked to the seventh cave and made the rock transparent too. His eyes narrowed as he saw a old man sitting inside.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This old man&#x2019;s hair was grey and his face was deathly pale. He sat there as if he had been there for an eternity. There were even more restrictions here than in the cave with the Enlightened Ones. They completely sealed this place shut.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment Wang Lin looked at the old man, the old man&#x2019;s eyes opened. His eyes were filled with madness as he stared at Wang Lin outside the rock and let out a roar. He charged like a beast, and spells appeared around him and he shot toward the rock.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the moment the old man&#x2019;s spells appeared, the restrictions in the cave flashed quickly and absorbed the spells. The old man roared even more intensely and his hands smashed down on the rock.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No sound came out. Wang Lin was able to see the old man&#x2019;s roar, but not hear it. The mountain rock remained motionless.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a long time, the old man seemed tired. He stared at Wang Lin as he retreated and sat back down. The restrictions returned to normal.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Could he be&#x2026; a Defying One!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After looking at the three caves, Wang Lin had already understood that these people were Sima Mo&#x2019;s sect members. Sima Mo had brought them back and sealed them inside the cave in an attempt to awaken them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, looking at it now, Sima Mo didn&#x2019;t succeed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;The jades inside the Lost Ones and Enlightened Ones&#x2019; caves should contain the Time Restriction! Sima Mo&#x2019;s thought was that if one of them awakened, they would only need to learn the restriction to open it.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Letting out a sigh, Wang Lin walked to the eighth cave. The restriction on the eighth cave wasn&#x2019;t a Time Restriction. After a glance, Wang Lin waved his hand and the restriction dissipated. The rock rumbled and moved aside.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the eighth cave opened, Wang Lin sucked in a breath of cold air. He stared at the items inside and finally let out a breath after a long time.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was half a skeleton inside this cave!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the lower half of a skeleton, and there were countless words carved on it. This skeleton was completely black. The restriction on the ground sealed the skeleton completely.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;So the lost skeleton from the stone tablet is here&#x2026;&#x201D;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#xA0;Wang Lin looked at the skeleton and felt a powerful force tugging at his mind. He retreated a few steps and cut off that bit of connection without any hesitation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After focusing himself, Wang Lin pondered for a bit. He wasn&#x2019;t willing to leave just like this. He looked at the skeleton and saw that there was a deep fracture on its right leg. Although it wasn&#x2019;t disconnected, the wound was very deep.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a long time, Wang Lin&#x2019;s hands formed a seal. He pointed at his body several times and placed a large amount of restrictions on his mind. Then his hand reached out and took out the crystal sword he had gotten from Master Ashen Pine. He left a sliver of his thoughts inside the sword and slowly walked forward. It was only few dozen feet, but Wang Lin was extremely careful every step. He slowly arrived next to the skeleton, squatted down, and reached for the fracture on the right leg without any hesitation. His mind extended out from his right hand.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was using his soul to comprehend!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment Wang Lin&#x2019;s divine sense touched the bone, he felt a bang in his mind.</span></p>

If someone looked from outside the cave, they would see that Wang Lin&#x2019;s body was trembling, his face was pale, and that his face had even become twisted. His right hand trembled even more intensely, but it was glued to the skeleton.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That skeleton suddenly gave off a golden glow.

If I take your Zhan family soul, I can use it as a guide to find where that Old Ghost Zhan hid his old bones for his Void Tribulant. Then I&#x2019;ll take his skeleton and force out the dao essence from both of you! I&#x2019;ll destroy his nirvana and complete the heavenly plan!&#x201D; The ancient voice sound exhausted and gradually disappeared.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, even the world Wang Lin was in began to shatter.

The black light headed for Wang Lin&#x2019;s hand and was about to enter his body.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just at this instant, the crystal sword Wang Lin had left in the cave suddenly shined and charged toward him. It moved between Wang Lin&#x2019;s fingertip and the skeleton, causing them to separate.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin&#x2019;s body trembled as he became sober and retreated without hesitation. He stared at the skeleton, and his mind was in turmoil.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Zhan family ancestor, Zhan Xingye!&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin&#x2019;s expression became gloomy. He knew that the Zhan family ancestor from Allheaven had disappeared among the stars, and no one knew where he had gone. Zhan Xingye was extremely talented, and at some point he accidently found the Battle Scroll. He studied it to comprehend the Battle Domain and then disappeared in pursuit of a higher realm.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter how much his future offsprings searched for him, they couldn&#x2019;t find any clue of where Zhan Xingye was.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t think he&#x2026; would be Zhan Xingye!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;The person who killed Zhan Xingye using the law of origin could be the Sovereign!&#x201D;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#xA0;Wang Lin&#x2019;s expression became even more gloomy. Thinking back about what happened, his heart felt cold. That seven-colored light was a spell similar to Sundered Night, but far more powerful. Just one spell was enough to kill Zhan Xingye without him being able to resist at all!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin&#x2019;s mouth became dry. While pondering, he frowned and his eyes lit up.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Something is wrong! If Zhan Xingye was killed like this, how could such a clear will remain? If he died, his will should have dissipated. Even though the will still exists, it shouldn&#x2019;t be this clear&#x2026; Also, the voice of the Sovereign at the end clearly seemed exhausted&#x2026;&#x201D;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#xA0;Ideas raced through Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind, but he couldn&#x2019;t find any clues.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Spirit Void, Void Tribulant! Could these be two realms in the third step? When I comprehended the Battle Scrolls, I saw an old man. The Battle Scrolls were created by that person. He once said that his cultivation level had reached the void and that he was going to have a breakthrough. Could it be&#x2026; could it be that he was the &#x2018;Old Ghost Zhan&#x2019; the Sovereign mentioned...</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;From the way he spoke, this Sovereign seems to dread this Old Ghost Zhan. In order to find where this Old Ghost Zhan hid his bones, the Sovereign gave the Battle Scroll to Zhan Xingye. He let Zhan Xingye cultivate the battle domain before killing him for his soul. All of this was for the sake of the heavenly plan. What exactly is this heavenly plan?&#x201D;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#xA0;Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind became even more clear. Although there were some things he didn&#x2019;t understand, his thoughts were clear.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;The four stone tablets and two intact skeletons.

When he saw the faint, golden light, he began to ponder. He had a total of three Battle Scrolls inside his storage space!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had opened the first two, but he hadn&#x2019;t opened the third one since obtaining them from the Zhan family. After pondering for a bit, he looked at the skeleton and his right hand reached at the void. Three balls of light flew out.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside the three balls of light were the three Battle Scrolls!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the Battle Scrolls appeared, the golden light that was forced into a corner by the black light flew out from the skeleton. It went straight into the three Battle Scrolls, and as the golden light shined, the scrolls fused together.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This strange scene was not outside of Wang Lin&#x2019;s expectations. His gaze was serious as he stared at the three Battle Scrolls fusing. After a moment, the fusion ended and the cave was covered in a golden light. An illusionary word &#x201C;Battle&#x201D; appeared before Wang Lin.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The word &#x201C;Battle&#x201D; released a golden glow and a terrifying aura. It headed straight for Wang Lin and was put into his storage space.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;You obtained the Battle Scroll and inadvertently became Old Ghost Zhan&#x2019;s cross-generation inheritor. Because of you, Sovereign found out where Old Ghost Zhan had buried his bones&#x2026; Countless years later, I obtained the Battle Scrolls from your descendant&#x2026; Today I saw your remains&#x2026;&#x201D;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#xA0;Wang Lin revealed a complicated look before letting out a heavy sigh. He then left the cave and sealed it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin didn&#x2019;t open the ninth cave as he wasn&#x2019;t able to break the restriction on it. He saw that it was filled with seven-colored gas, but he couldn&#x2019;t see what was inside.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside the valley, Wang Lin looked at Sima Mo&#x2019;s remains and pondered for a long time, then he left. Before Wang Lin left, he went to the first cave where the mosquito beast was and left a lot of origin crystals.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Walking out of the valley, Wang Lin&#x2019;s eyes lit up. He needed to see the tablet that he saw with his mind before; he needed to see the other half of Zhan Xingye&#x2019;s remains.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After searching the memories of Pang Decai and Master Ashen Pine, Wang Lin was no longer unfamiliar with this Seven-Colored Realm. All the routes were deeply imprinted in his mind. He moved like a ray of light but didn&#x2019;t fly, instead moving along the ground.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He moved through the various valleys before he arrived at where restriction the old woman in green was trapped in. The restriction had been opened and the old woman had disappeared.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After taking a glance, Wang Lin didn&#x2019;t stop. He passed by the mountain into the fog. Wang Lin was very familiar with this area. The murmuring of the Enlightened Ones entered his ears and some even drifted by him.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The more Wang Lin learned, the more he understood the Enlightened Ones. They were all former cultivators, but they had become things to help someone else nourish dao.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin could even imagine that these Enlightened Ones were once amazing talents who had high understanding of dao. That&#x2019;s why they were trapped by the dao scripture and became Enlightened Ones to nourish dao.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He let out a sigh in his heart, but he didn&#x2019;t stop and charged ahead. He gradually saw a giant statue in the fog. Wang Lin stopped before the statue.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes shined as he jumped up and arrived next to the head of the statue.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Master Ashen Pine&#x2019;s memories, his cultivation method was called the Hundred Blood Origin Forms the Nascent Soul. The seventh spirit of the Sealed Realm he summoned was comprehended from this statue.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This cultivation method allowed him to cultivate a total of nine nascent soul-like things, but they were far more powerful than nascent souls. More importantly, they would allow Master Ashen Pine to increase the speed at which he cultivated a spell by nine fold.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was even more shocking was that each nascent soul could form a spell. Often, there were many spells that couldn&#x2019;t be cultivated together. No matter how good they were, you had to make a choice. The old woman&#x2019;s Ying Yang Ancestral spell was like this.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this was not an issue for Master Ashen Pine. His nine blood nascent souls could cultivate separately.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before the battle with Wang Lin, one of the nascent souls was taken by the old woman, and then in the battle with Wang Lin, both of them were seriously injured, so he wasn&#x2019;t able to use the spells inside them.</span></p>

The power of an ancient god rushed through the void and a thunderous rumble echoed as if it could destroy the world. It quickly closed in on the youth.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth&#x2019;s face was pale. He knew that he could not escape. If he wanted to live, he had to fight! However, his heart felt bitter. Even if he fought, what were the chances of him surviving&#x2026; He didn&#x2019;t know.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it he was outside and he was fighting with one of his own clan members, he could at least surrender. However, this person was a Sealed Realm cultivator and also an ancient god, a royal ancient god. From the records from his family, his clan had betrayed the ancient gods. Even if he surrendered, he couldn&#x2019;t escape the fate of death and having his soul searched.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;What exactly is this damn place?

His hands formed a seal and his body became even more crystal-like, as if he was covered in moonlight. As Wang Lin&#x2019;s fist closed in, he began to rotate and formed a vortex. Within the vortex, a giant, crescent moon appeared!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment Wang Lin&#x2019;s fist landed, there was a thunderous rumble. The crescent moon trembled violently but didn&#x2019;t collapse. However, blood came out from the corner of the youth&#x2019;s mooth. He clench his teeth and surged all the power in his body. He then pushed forward and shouted, &#x201C;Rebound Moon Force!&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, the light from the crescent moon became blinding and the image of an ancient god punch shot out at Wang Lin!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin&#x2019;s expression was unchanged as he sneered and lifted his right hand for another punch. At the same time, he took a step and closed in at an unimaginable speed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The punch landed with the punch formed by the crescent moon and a roar echoed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;How can the spell of a slave clan fight against an ancient god?&#x201D; Wang Lin rushed forward and his right fist continued to throw punches at the vortex. The rumbling continued and the youth inside the vortex continued to retreat. Every step he took back caused his body to tremble violently.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Wang Lin was like a battle celestial.

At this instant, all sounds were suppressed by these rumbles.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Break for me!&#x201D; Wang Lin&#x2019;s voice was calm, but it contained an invisible pressure. At this moment, his body rotated and his right foot kicked the vortex.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the popping sounds echoed, the vortex collapsed.

It was the youth covered in blood. He was thrown into the distance in an arc.

At the same time, his hands formed a seal and he pointed to between his eyebrows.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Forbidden Moon Spell, God&#x2019;s Wrath!&#x201D; This youth knew that his Moon-Devouring Clan had an ancient forbidden spell. He was not supposed to use this spell until it was the last resort, because it was humiliating for his Moon-Devouring Clan to use it!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he roared, he knelt down on the ground. Wang Lin closed in. The youth&#x2019;s hand formed a strange seal and he began worshiping.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Lend the power of the gods&#x2019; souls to the members of my Moon-Devouring Clan!&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment his voice echoed, a powerful ancient god power appeared around the youth.

His eyes became filled with confusion and then liberation as he gradually disappeared&#x2026; It had been a long time since a royal ancient god had appeared among the ancient gods. The ancient god soul that protected the Moon-Devouring Clan was just a sliver of will&#x2026; Back then, it was a royal ancient god that decided to protect the slave Moon-Devouring Clan, and the entire ancient god clan carried it out without hesitation for a long time. Even as time passed and they died, the will that existed in the world continued to shelter them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This would go on until another royal ancient god appeared to give the order to stop.

With his experience, how could he know this big secret? He didn&#x2019;t know, and that&#x2019;s why he was stupid enough to borrow the power of the ancient gods before a royal ancient god like Wang Lin!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;From now on, the ancient gods will no longer shelter the Moon-Devouring Clan, they will destroy the Moon-Devouring Clan!&#x201D; These were the last words the youth heard. Wang Lin walked forward and a kick swept forward. A rumble echoed through the youth&#x2019;s body as all his bones collapsed, but his flesh didn&#x2019;t disintegrate. Instead, he was swept toward the skeleton under the stone tablet by Wang Lin&#x2019;s kick. &#xA0;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a bang, his body overlapped with the skeleton and his shoulder was pierced by the two seven-colored nails! A burst of earth-shattering cries came from the youth as his body was affixed by the two seven-colored nails. The pain of having your dao sucked away and your soul constantly crushed was not something an ordinary person could endure.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin didn&#x2019;t immediately kill him but made him suffer the pain Zhan Xingye had gone through.

His divine sense rushed in and searched his soul by force. After obtaining the memories, the youth was about to pass out. However, the pain was so intense that he was unable to pass out. He couldn&#x2019;t kill himself and could only endure the endless torture until he slowly died.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin withdrew his right hand and let out a sigh.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the fire on the Vermillion Bird reached a new height.

This shocked the entire Scatter Thunder Clan and caused all their hearts to skip a beat!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone&#x2019;s expressions changed and they rushed over. The moment they spread out their divine senses, the eternal thunder lake suddenly disappeared without a trace as if it was taken away&#x2026;. After 10 breaths of time, it returned, and although it returned, this scene caused endless panic and fear among the Scatter Thunder Clan.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Ancient Star System, there was an area where the Fire Sparrow Clan was located&#x2026; This place was very similar to the Vermillion Bird Divine Sect, where the entire region was burning.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similarly, there were countless Vermillion Bird statues erected on temples.

However, at this moment, the youth from the Moon-Devouring Clan summoned the ancient god shadow in the Seven-Colored Realm, and Wang Lin gave the command as a royal ancient god to annul the ancient covenant!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thunderous rumbles came from the nine ancient god statues and cracks covered the statues. This sudden change caused the nine people who were cultivating to awaken from their cultivation. They were shocked, terrified, and filled with confusion.

In the blink of an eye, it turned to dust and disappeared under the dumbfounded gazes of the nine cultivators.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that the remaining seven statues were collapsing as well, their expressions changed greatly!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Do whatever it takes to stop these slave statues from collapsing!&#x201D; A heaven-shaking voice swept by with an unimaginable divine sense.

Every awakening of the mark meant the metamorphosis of the Vermillion Bird, and it represented the heaven-shaking power of fire. In ancient times, the first Vermillion Bird awakening wasn&#x2019;t uncommon, but as time passed, due to the diluting bloodline, fewer and fewer people awakened.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There is no need to even talk about people who awakened a second time.

The third awakening seemed to have disappeared. Only in ancient primal times did there seem to be a few with shocking talent that reached this realm! However, no one knew if it was true or not.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those who awakened three time were like the fire spirits of the world, and they controlled all fire!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Wang Lin was going through his third awakening. The temperature of the fire inside the restriction became higher and higher.

The armor melted into liquid, but it didn&#x2019;t fall. Instead, it was absorbed by Wang Lin&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sea of flames that came out from Wang Lin&#x2019;s body increased until it filled the entire area within the restriction.

The moment it appeared, it caused large amounts of black gas to appear from the mountain beneath him as if it was being refined. Before the black gas could spread, it dissipated due to the impact of the fire.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One could only see the mountain shrink and begin to collapse. Cracks even appeared on the stone gate on the mountain. The young woman in green trembled and was turned into gas. She disappeared without a trace. What was even more shocking was what happened to the beast soul sealed by the seven-light. Some of the light collapsed and the beast soul inside was burned to death. However, the beast&#x2019;s dao intent didn&#x2019;t dissipate, and it fused with the fire!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, this caused the fire to seem like it contained will! It wasn&#x2019;t just one will, but countless wills, but in the end they would all be something under Wang Lin&#x2019;s control!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just a moment, the mountain completely collapsed. Even the rubble was burnt to nothing. Only the rank 12 and 13 beast souls were lucky enough to survive due to the seven-colored light around them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the mountain collapsed, the temperature of the fire reached a new peak. Under the powerful impact of the fire, the weakest point of the Time Restriction, which was the crack, was finally wasn&#x2019;t able to withstand it anymore and was torn open. The fire seemed to find a place to vent, and it immediately rushed out of the crack. In an instant, it began burning the restriction.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the thunderous rumbles echoed, the Time Restriction turned into a burning ball of fire and immediately collapsed!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment it collapsed, the world was shocked! Large amounts of fire rushed out and spread across the Seven-Colored Realm. In the mountain in the depths of the realm, the white-haired old man suddenly opened his eyes and became filled with shock. He quickly got up and looked toward where Wang Lin was!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Ancient Star System, in the palace that was floating among the boundless stars, it was no longer bright.

The white Vermillion Bird struggled to fly up. It seemed the third awakening was a test and a crisis for it!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin&#x2019;s mind was blank. He seemed to have become a Vermillion Bird. The fire seed inside its body continued to release endless heat, but the more it released, the more heat it had. In the end, it seemed like it was going to burn itself!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had a feeling he would be burned to ashes if he was just a bit slow in releasing the heat.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an endless cycle. The more heat he released, the more heat there was. This cycle continued, and the Vermillion Bird let out an earth-shattering cry, like the fierce roar before death.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin hadn&#x2019;t experienced this feeling during the two awakenings from before. The third time was extremely difficult! He felt like the heat from his body was even burning his origin soul, which surprised Wang Lin. He didn&#x2019;t think the Vermillion Bird&#x2019;s third awakening would be so different.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The heat increased to the point where his body couldn&#x2019;t release it fast enough. The burning feeling became more clearer, and the skin on his body became even more chapped.

A powerful heat wave came out from his mouth during his painful roar. The heatwave circled around him, and every hair on his body struggled against the heat wave.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Vermillion Bird&#x2026; awakening&#x2026; Vermillion Bird&#x2026;&#x201D;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#xA0;Wang Lin&#x2019;s consciousness became a bit blurry.
